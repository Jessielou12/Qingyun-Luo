In the process of organising the learning materials, the files were divided into three main categories in order to organise the learning materials in a more systematic and logical way. Firstly, we have a folder called 'assessment practice', which contains the files used to practice the questions on the moodle platform. These practice questions have been carefully selected to help learners master key concepts and prepare for exams.

Secondly, the second category is a folder called "exercise", which contains practice questions mainly from the HackerRank website, especially from its Python programming area (https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/). HackerRank is a popular platform for programming challenges and competitions that provides a wide range of programming topics to help developers improve their programming skills. Through these exercises, learners can deepen their understanding and application of Python programming in practice. In addition to the material from the online platforms and hands-on exercises, a portion of the documentation comes from self-study books, specifically Learn Python 3 the Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw (2017). This book is respected by many beginners for its practice-driven approach to teaching and providing learners with a solid foundation in programming. Improvement comes from constant practice through output python.

Finally, the third category of folders organises drafts of websites created during the individual's learning process, including HTML and CSS files. This section of material reflects the learner's progress in learning the fundamentals and skills of web development, demonstrating the ability to apply theory to practice. These drafts are not only a demonstration of learning outcomes, but also provide a valuable reference for PMA's projects.
